# Wireframer

## [Try it out!](http://wireframer.cs.stonybrook.edu/)

Wireframer is a simple to use yet powerful wireframing application created 
as part of the Wolfie-Tools application suite.

Users are able to create/login to accounts and create wireframe diagrams for 
the purpose of UI mock-ups. Wireframes are saved to an online database (MongoDB) 
and are only accessable to the user that created them. Outside of basic CRUD 
capabilities, editing a wireframe supports drag and drop, drag corner to resize, 
and various property manipulation depending on the element.

This repository is simply for gathering feedback on the Wireframer application; 
the actual codebase is currently not public. If you have any suggestions, bug 
reports, questions, or otherwise, please take a look at the 
[issues page](https://github.com/NathanWine/Wireframer-Feedback/issue) and see 
if a similar post has been made. If not, feel free to open up an issue to 
start a discussion!

Wireframer was created using the MERN stack, that is 
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), 
[Express](https://www.express.com/), 
[React](https://reactjs.org/), and 
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), 
along with simple HTML and CSS styling. It also makes use of 
[react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd) 
for some basic functionality.

Wireframer's development started in Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing. The 
development team is comprised soley of 
[Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) 
students working under 
[Professor Richard McKenna](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/RichardMcKenna).
